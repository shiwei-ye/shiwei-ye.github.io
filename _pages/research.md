<summary> Abstract </summary>
We investigate open-source innovation by public firms and the private value it generates for these firms. Unlike patents, which grant inventors exclusive rights to their inventions, open-source innovations can be used by anyone. Nevertheless, using an extensive dataset of public-firm activity on GitHub, we find that open-source activity is widespread.  Firms with open-source projects represent 68% of the U.S. stock market across 86% of industries.  We estimate the value of all projects in our sample to be nearly 25 billion, with the average project generating \$832,000.  Firms facing less competition generate more value, suggesting they capture a larger portion of the total value of their innovation.  Open-source value significantly predicts firm growth, but it also stimulates patenting by other firms and does not result in creative destruction. These results contribute to our understanding of how innovation generates private value in the absence of excludability.

<summary> Abstract </summary>
This paper examines how political compaigns during the 2016 U.S. presidential election influences perceptions of economic uncertainty and subsequent household financial behaviors. Using a difference-in-differences approach, I show that Clinton's rallies reduced perceived economic uncertainty, particularly macro uncertainty. Moreover, areas hosting rallies showed an increase in P2P and mortgage loan applications after Clinton's visits, aligning with life-cycle models with precautionary motives. Effects are stronger in areas having higher initial level of economic uncertainty. In contrast, Trump's rallies did not significantly influence uncertainty perceptions or borrowing decisions. These findings shed light on a novel channel through which campaign information shapes real financial decisions, with effects contingent on the candidate involved.

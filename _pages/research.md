<summary> Abstract </summary>
I study how Generative AI (GenAI) reshapes effort allocation and firm value by affecting both productivity and signaling. Using developer-level data from U.S. public firms' open-source projects, I construct a novel AI exposure measure and exploit GitHub Copilot's launch as a shock. I find that GenAI increases coding productivity for senior developers while juniors create more valuable novel projects. This is consistent with seniors capturing productivity gains while career-concerned juniors shift toward producing more effective signals of ability in response to GenAI's erosion in coding's signaling value. Changes in signaling incentives are reflected in project selection, programming language choices, and job moves across firms. Firm-level value creation depends on alignment along signaling incentives. A multitask signaling model rationalizes these patterns. These findings shed new light on the dual role of GenAI as a productivity tool and a force reshaping labor market signaling.

<summary> Abstract </summary>
Open-source innovation lacks the legal excludability viewed as essential for generating private value from innovation. Nonetheless, using investor reactions to GitHub releases by U.S. public firms from 2015-2023, we estimate an average private value of \$849,000 per project. Extrapolation to all projects during this period implies a total value of \$909 billion. Firms facing less competition release more projects, and both lower competition and restrictive licenses generate more private value. This value predicts firm growth, but peer benefits are modest. Overall, firms generate private value from open-source innovation by limiting spillovers, challenging the notion that open source fosters industry-wide growth.

<summary> Abstract </summary>
This paper examines how political compaigns during the 2016 U.S. presidential election influences perceptions of economic uncertainty and subsequent household financial behaviors. Using a difference-in-differences approach, I show that Clinton's rallies reduced perceived economic uncertainty, particularly macro uncertainty. Moreover, areas hosting rallies showed an increase in P2P and mortgage loan applications after Clinton's visits, aligning with life-cycle models with precautionary motives. Effects are stronger in areas having higher initial level of economic uncertainty. In contrast, Trump's rallies did not significantly influence uncertainty perceptions or borrowing decisions. These findings shed light on a novel channel through which campaign information shapes real financial decisions, with effects contingent on the candidate involved.
